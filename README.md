# üåßÔ∏è RainGuard

**Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Weather Insurance Protocol**

RainGuard is a decentralized insurance protocol that uses trusted weather data to trigger automatic payouts for climate-related risks. It enables anyone to build tailored protection against unpredictable weather events like droughts, heatwaves, or storms, without dealing with traditional insurers or slow, manual claims processes.

## üöÄ Features

- **Weather-Based Insurance**: Create custom insurance policies based on specific weather conditions, locations, and timeframes
- **Expert-Driven Pricing**: Risk experts compete to offer the best premium rates through transparent bidding
- **Automated Payouts**: Smart contracts automatically trigger payouts when weather conditions are met
- **Gasless Transactions**: Circle Paymaster integration enables gasless transactions paid in USDT
- **Reputation System**: Experts build reputation scores based on their risk assessment accuracy
- **Real-Time Data**: Chainlink Functions integration with AccuWeather for reliable weather data
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI designed for users with no blockchain experience

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

The protocol consists of several smart contracts deployed on **Mantle** and **Zircuit**:

- **`InsuranceManager`**: Core contract handling the entire insurance lifecycle
- **`Reputation`**: Manages expert reputation scores and performance tracking
- **`EventsLib`**: Event definitions for contract interactions
- **`MockUSDC`**: Test USDC token for development
- **`OracleMock`**: Mock oracle for testing weather data integration

### Frontend

Built with modern web technologies:
- **Next.js 15** (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Scaffold-ETH 2** hooks for seamless blockchain interactions
- **RainbowKit** for wallet connections
- **Tailwind CSS** with DaisyUI for styling
- **Wagmi** for Ethereum interactions

## üìã Insurance Lifecycle

1. **Request Creation**: Users create insurance requests with coverage amount, location, timeframe, and weather conditions
2. **Expert Bidding**: Risk experts submit offers with premiums and risk assessments
3. **Offer Selection**: Users select the best offer based on premium and expert reputation
4. **Pool Funding**: Investors fund the payout pool with USDC
5. **Premium Payment**: Users pay premiums, automatically distributed to experts (5%) and investors (95%)
6. **Policy Activation**: Smart contract activates the policy for the specified timeframe
7. **Automatic Settlement**: Chainlink Functions fetch weather data and trigger payouts if conditions are met
8. **Reputation Update**: Expert reputation scores are updated based on payout accuracy
